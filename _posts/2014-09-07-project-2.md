description: Trinity United Methodist Church was looking to improve its contemporary worship service.  As part of this they needed to update their current sound system, replacing the failing audio console with an updated console, and updating the speakers to handle a more modern style of music, while still maintaining the visual asthetics of the traditional sanctuary space.
