description: As Atlee Church was looking to upgrade their phone systems to VoIP they realized that their network at some of their locations was not going to be able to support it.  As a result we came in and upgraded the network to support the VoIP while still allowing the existing tenant networks and WiFi to continue operating, upgrading some of the wiring, the gateway and switches and finally installing the VoIP phones and confirming they worked.
