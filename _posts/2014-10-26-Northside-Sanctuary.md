description: As part of the merger between Northminster Baptist Church and Atlee Community Church, Atlee desired to remodel the sanctuary that had not been used regularly in over a decade, and move services back into the sanctuary.  This required a major update to the building, complete with an overhaul of the electrical system, updated and significantly larger audio and lighting systems, and the addition of a projections system.
